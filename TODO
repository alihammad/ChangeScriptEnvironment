TODO
- script accepts static database names file
- Two more args - from_env and to_env (e.g. P and O means production to Development)
- does not read config file rather generated config file on the go using the parameterized db file
- based on the "from env", the conf file generated will be for "to env"
- Once the config file is generated, pass the file/directory thorugh the config file to generatet the script 
  according to the "to_env"
- Keep an option to "just"  parameterize the script - or create a new script for that purpose
- write the entire db file in ../etc/config.ini in the following format
	APDL : s/\bA|from_env|DL\b/A|to_env|DL/ig
	from_env: x
	to_env: y
	DB_Name: APDL
	find AxDL and replace with AyDL
	find A_DL and replace with A_DL
	SET1: replace second character of db name with "from_env"
	SET2: repalce second character od db name with "to_env"
	form the sed string and write in config.ini
